Project Description

ExchangeEase is a comprehensive "Survival Dashboard" designed specifically for international exchange students. It provides real-time essential data—including currency conversion, emergency contacts, local transit updates, and a community-driven gig/guide network—all in one centralized, location-aware interface.

The Problem statement

Moving to a new country for studies is overwhelming. Students often struggle to find reliable local information, manage different currencies, understand public transport, and connect with seniors or locals who can help with visa or housing issues, leading to "culture shock" and safety concerns.

The Solution

ExchangeEase solves this by aggregating "survival essentials" into a single glassmorphic dashboard. It uses real-time maps and location-based data to provide immediate access to emergency services, financial tools, and a peer-to-peer network for jobs and mentorship.
