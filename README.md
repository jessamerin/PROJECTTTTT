Project Description
ExchangeEase is a city-wide survival dashboard designed especially for exchange students. It provides navigation support, bus routes, emergency contacts, part-time job listings, and student-friendly locations — all in one simple web platform.

The Problem Statement
Every year, students move to a completely new city or country for exchange programs. They struggle with:
•	Finding reliable bus routes 🚌
•	Locating student-friendly hangout spots ☕
•	Knowing what to do in emergencies 🚨
•	Searching for part-time job opportunities 💼
Most tools are scattered (Maps, job portals, local guides), making it overwhelming for newcomers.

The Solution
ExchangeEase solves this by combining:
•	🗺 Smart navigation using interactive maps
•	🚌 Student-friendly bus route assistance
•	🚨 One-tap emergency contact section
•	💼 Curated part-time job listings
•	📍 Recommended student hotspots
All in a single, easy-to-use survival dashboard.
